5/9 5:25 PM, started a new run. Everything was good. 

==================================================
5/10 

7:53 AM, program stopped. checked. restsrted. everything was fine

8:10 AM, Jingbo went down to install the DUTs.

8:13 AM, ch3 a lot of errors. Then back (i2c ok, 129 mA ok, no error). 

8:17 AM, restarted. everything was good. 

8:30 AM, tested crate motion, (309, 152) original, moved 310, 311, 312, 309, 319, 242 (-67)
data still good. 

10:05 AM, added a fuse in 233 V bias loop. 

? , Ch8 lot of errors, then not heart beat, but ch0-7 recovered, Ch8 lost

11:55 AM, inspected

11:57 AM, restarted FPGA and the main.py program
ch3 lots erros
then ch8 lots of errors
ch0-7 normal, but no ch8

12:00 PM, restarted FPGA and main.py
after ch3 and ch8 errors, ok

12:01 PM, restarted

12:03 PM, restarted, still ch8 not back to normal

12:07 PM, inspection done
restarted, 

12:12 PM, rewrote iic, restarted program

12:18 PM, restarted
Ch0-7 ok, ch8 no data. will not continue to start over
rename data as _pre

=================================================
3:44 PM, about to start beam
restarted the program main.py
beam position x = 242 (309-67=242), y = 152
beam not ready
probably till 4:30 PM

4:25 PM, calling MCR now

4:30 PM, maybe start 15 minutes later

4:49 PM, data ok, no beam

5:03 PM, 3 people came to the beam room and left

5:12 PM, beam come shortly

==================================================
5:15 PM, in 1 minute

5:16 PM, beam started (supposed)

5:21 PM, still no error in labjack

5:23 PM, a large pulse
no error

5:29 PM, a large pulse in labjack

5:38 PM, no error

5:39 PM, a large pulse in labjack

5:53 PM, a large pulse in labjack

6:39 PM, no error, i2c ok, idd 124 mA

7:32 PM, asked to stop the beam, no error so far. 
waited for 5 minutes
stopped the program

======================================================
7:39 PM, restarted the program

======================================================
5/11 Wednesday
8:58 AM, restarted the main program. Still no error. i2c ok. Idd 124 mA. 

9:45 AM, work in beam room done
DUTs back to center of the beam (309)
use tape to fix the board position
take off the Al foils and store
put a new foil (2B) back to the beam (after 9:55) (GBCR2 and ET2 board not touched)
add Ch7 amplifier signal (the center) to BNC cable #15

found I2C error.
After rewrite, read ok
restart main.py. I2C ok. Idd 124 mA.

ET2 still OK.

10:25 AM, lanjack run 5 minutes, no large pulse

10:39 AM, Sue in meeting. Beam in 20 minutes

11:01 AM, beam in 5 minutes

11:02 AM, lot of errors
then back to normal for a while
lots of errors
back to error injection

11:22 Am, moved 309 to 304 mm, but moving table not working.
still lots of errors

11:36 AM, reset position to 0 mm, then back to 304 mm
at 0 mm, no error
at 304 mm, lots of errors

11:49 AM, moved to 299 mm
lots of errors

12:01 PM, moved to 294 mm
lots of errors

12:14 PM, moved to 289 mm
lots of errors

12:26 PM, moved to 279 mm
ch3 continuous errors at low rate


12:34 PM, redownlod FPGA
restart main.py
no flush error
only injection error
leave for lunch

12:53 PM, I2C error

1:25 PM, stopped main.py
run iic.py. Still i2c errors.
a few times, always errors.

1:30 PM, restarted main.py with i2c all read back 255

1:53 PM, ET2 i2c program dead

2:24 PM, unplug ISS USB cable and plug back
restart ET2main_read.py
ET2 I2C OK

2:27 PM, ET2 I2C dead again
plug and plug back
restart i2cmain_read.py
ET2 I2C ok


2:31 PM, re-program FPGA
restart main.py
i2c still error (255)
idd 124 mA
7 RX and 1 TX ok

3:38 PM, normal

4:34 PM, stopped main.py
program stopped. Data to 4:02 PM. 
prepare to move


4:36 PM, move to 281 mm
data OK.

4:40 PM, program main.py stopped
restarted
data ok. 

4:42 PM, move to 283 mm.
data OK

4:47 PM, move to 285 mm
data OK

4:52 PM, move to 287 mm
errors

4:56 PM, move to 285 mm
errors

4:59 PM, move to 383 mm
ch4 low error rate

5:02 PM, move to 281 mm

5:20 PM, beam stopped

5:24 PM, restart program
copy data

=====================================
5/12 
7:58 AM, come to the lab
program stopped at 3:07:52 AM
I2C back before program stopped.

8:03 AM, restart main.py
I2C ok
Idd 123 mA
data no error (including ch8)


8:18 AM, stopped everything
Disassemble everything
